- `suggestions:getExecutionStatus` - Get real-time execution status and progress
- `suggestions:cancelExecution` - Cancel ongoing suggestion execution
- `suggestions:undoTransaction` - Rollback completed operations

#### 3. **Event System Enhancement**
- `suggestion:executionStarted` - Execution initiation notifications
- `suggestion:executionProgress` - Real-time progress updates
- `suggestion:executionCompleted` - Successful completion events
- `suggestion:executionFailed` - Error handling and recovery notifications

#### 4. **Dashboard Workflow Integration**
- Complete UI integration with new suggestion execution system
- Real-time progress tracking and user feedback
- Workflow step progression with execution state management
- Comprehensive error handling and recovery interfaces
- Undo capability with user-friendly transaction management

#### 5. **Type Safety and API Design**
