## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 1.7 established comprehensive UI infrastructure with Dashboard.tsx containing a 5-step workflow (Setup, Select Directory, Scan Files, Review Suggestions, Execute Operations). The Dashboard currently has placeholder functionality for the "Start Scan" step with a button that logs 'Starting scan...' and advances to the next step. Story 1.5 implemented the complete AI analysis pipeline with FileAnalysisService, ConfidenceScorer, and database integration. The integration point is connecting the Dashboard workflow to the existing analysis infrastructure.

### System Architecture Integration
[Source: architecture/system-components-logical.md]
- **Renderer Process**: Dashboard.tsx manages workflow state, FileAnalysisService integration through IPC
- **Main Process**: FileAnalysisService orchestrates Agent Manager for AI analysis task dispatch
- **IPC Communication**: Existing preview-update and analysis-progress channels for real-time updates
- **Agent Manager**: Existing slot-based concurrency control and resource management for analysis tasks

### Data Flow Integration
[Source: architecture/data-flow-sequence-typical-job.md]
The story implements steps 4-7 of the typical job flow:
4. **Task generation**: Connect Dashboard to existing task queue generation from scanned files
5. **Agent assignment**: Leverage existing Agent Manager slot allocation and task dispatch
6. **Inference**: Use existing Ollama integration and model inference pipeline
7. **Preview**: Connect existing preview-update IPC events to Dashboard display components

### Component Integration Requirements
[Source: docs/stories/1.7.ui-integration-user-experience.md]
**Existing Components to Leverage:**
- **Dashboard.tsx**: Current workflow orchestration component requiring analysis integration
- **FileAnalysisResults.tsx**: Complete UI component (600+ lines) for displaying analysis results
- **UserNotificationSystem.tsx**: Error handling and progress notification system (800+ lines)
- **AppStateContext.tsx**: Global state management for system status and workflow tracking (360 lines)

### IPC API Integration
[Source: architecture/ipc-apis-contracts.md]
**Existing Analysis Endpoints:**
- `analysis:start` - Begin analysis for files with progress tracking
- `preview-update` - Stream suggestion updates with file_id, suggested_name, confidence, reasoning
- `analysis:progress` - Report analysis progress with completed/total counts  
- `analysis:cancel` - Cancel ongoing analysis operations with cleanup

### FileAnalysisService Integration
[Source: docs/stories/1.5.file-analysis-rename-suggestions.md]
**Existing Service Capabilities:**
- **FileAnalysisService**: Complete analysis orchestration with Agent Manager integration
- **ConfidenceScorer**: AI suggestion validation and quality scoring (0-100% confidence)
- **Error Recovery**: Circuit breaker pattern with fallback mechanisms and retry logic
- **Real-time Updates**: IPC event streaming for progress and results

### Database Integration
[Source: architecture/storage-schema-suggested-sqlite-tables.md]
**Existing Tables Available:**
- `suggestions` table: file_id, suggested_name, confidence, reasoning, analysis_duration
- `scan_jobs` table: job tracking with rootPath, status, file counts
- `files` table: complete file metadata from directory scanning

### File Structure and Implementation Locations
[Source: architecture/dev-repo-layout-recommended.md]
**Primary Integration Points:**
- **Dashboard Component**: `/app/src/renderer/components/Dashboard.tsx` - Main workflow integration point
- **Analysis Service**: `/app/src/lib/file-analysis-service.ts` - Existing service to connect to
- **IPC Preload**: `/app/src/preload/preload.ts` - Existing analysis channels available
- **State Management**: `/app/src/renderer/store/AppStateContext.tsx` - Global state for analysis tracking

### Error Handling Strategy
[Source: architecture/observability-error-handling.md]
**Integration with Existing Error Systems:**
- **Analysis Failures**: Connect to existing FileAnalysisService error recovery mechanisms
- **UI Error Boundaries**: Leverage existing ErrorBoundary.tsx component (600+ lines)
- **Notification System**: Use existing UserNotificationSystem.tsx for user feedback
- **Retry Logic**: Build on existing circuit breaker pattern in analysis service

### Performance Requirements
[Source: architecture/data-flow-sequence-typical-job.md]
**Integration Performance Targets:**
- **Analysis Initiation**: UI response within 500ms of button click
- **Progress Updates**: Real-time updates every 100-500ms during analysis
- **Results Display**: FileAnalysisResults component load within 1 second

### Requirements Traceability

**Given-When-Then Mapping:**

**AC1 (Dashboard-FileAnalysisService Integration):**
- **Given** user has selected directory and model
- **When** user clicks "Start AI Analysis" button  
- **Then** Dashboard calls FileAnalysisService via `startFileAnalysis` IPC with proper parameters

**AC2 (Real-time Progress Display):**
- **Given** analysis is running
- **When** FileAnalysisService sends progress updates
- **Then** Dashboard displays current file, progress bar, and processing statistics

**AC3 (Results Integration):**
- **Given** analysis completes successfully
- **When** user advances to Review step
- **Then** Dashboard renders FileAnalysisResults component with analysis data

**AC4 (Workflow Progression):**
- **Given** analysis is in progress
- **When** progress updates are received
- **Then** workflow step indicator shows "active" status for scan step

**AC5 (Error Handling):**
- **Given** analysis fails or encounters errors
- **When** error occurs
- **Then** user sees friendly error message with retry option

**AC6 (Completion Workflow):**
- **Given** analysis completes with results
- **When** completion event is received
- **Then** workflow automatically advances to Review Suggestions step

**AC7 (Directory Scanning Preservation):**
- **Given** directory is selected
- **When** scan results are loaded
- **Then** existing directory scanning functionality remains intact and feeds analysis

**AC8 (Summary Statistics):**
- **Given** analysis completes
- **When** results are processed
- **Then** summary shows total files, success rate, processing time, suggestions count

### Test Architecture Assessment

**Excellent** test coverage with both unit and integration approaches:

**Unit Tests** (`Dashboard.test.tsx`):
- Component rendering and workflow structure validation
- Proper mocking of dependencies (DirectoryPicker, ModelSelector, FileAnalysisResults)
- Basic workflow progression testing

**Integration Tests** (`analysis-workflow-integration.test.ts`):
- End-to-end workflow validation from directory scan → analysis → completion
- Error scenario testing with proper mock error conditions
- Cancellation workflow testing
- IPC API integration verification

### Security Review

**PASS** - No security concerns identified:
- All user inputs are properly validated before passing to analysis service
- IPC communication uses existing secured channels with payload validation
- No direct file system access - relies on existing secured FileAnalysisService
- Error messages don't expose sensitive system information

### Performance Considerations

**EXCELLENT** - Performance optimized design:
- Uses React useCallback for event handlers to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Efficient state management with targeted updates only when needed
- Progress updates throttled by IPC layer to prevent UI flooding
- Proper cleanup of event listeners in useEffect hooks
- CSS animations use transforms for smooth performance

### Non-Functional Requirements Validation

**Security**: ✓ **PASS** - Uses secured IPC channels, no direct file access, proper input validation
