# Story 2.3: Execute AI-Recommended Operations

## Status
Ready

## Story
**As a** user (organized student),
**I want** to execute approved AI-recommended file operations through the existing batch operation system with full undo capabilities,
**so that** I can safely apply AI suggestions to organize my files while maintaining complete control and reversibility.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Connect approved suggestions from Story 2.2 (confidence-based filtering) to the existing BatchOperationManager for execution
2. Integrate suggestion execution with the existing TransactionalFileManager to provide atomic operations and undo capabilities
3. Display batch operation progress in the Dashboard workflow with real-time status updates and operation counts
4. Implement operation validation before execution using existing OperationValidator to prevent dangerous operations
5. Add user confirmation dialog showing operation preview with before/after file states and impact analysis
6. Enable users to selectively execute subsets of approved suggestions with batch grouping options
7. Integrate with existing OperationHistory component to show completed operations and enable undo functionality
8. Add error handling for operation failures with partial execution recovery and detailed error reporting
9. Implement background operation processing allowing users to continue workflow while operations execute
10. Connect operation completion to Dashboard workflow progression, enabling transition to final step (Review History)

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 2.2 completed confidence-based operation filtering with AutoApprovalService, ManualReviewQueue, and comprehensive suggestion filtering. The AutoApprovalService processes filtered suggestions and integrates with BatchOperationManager for automated operations. Story 2.1 established the Dashboard analysis integration with real-time progress tracking and FileAnalysisResults display. This story connects the final piece: executing approved suggestions through the existing transactional operation system.

### System Architecture Integration
[Source: architecture/system-components-logical.md]
- **Renderer Process**: Dashboard.tsx workflow orchestration, OperationPreviewModal, progress tracking UI
- **Main Process**: SuggestionExecutionService coordination, BatchOperationManager integration, TransactionalFileManager execution
- **IPC Communication**: Existing batch operation channels (batch:started, batch:progress, batch:completed) for real-time updates
- **Worker Processes**: Existing batch operation processing with progress reporting and error handling

### Data Flow Integration
[Source: architecture/data-flow-sequence-typical-job.md]
The story implements steps 8-10 of the typical job flow:
8. **User Decision**: Execute approved suggestions from confidence filtering and manual review queue
9. **Transactional Operations**: Apply suggestions through existing BatchOperationManager â†’ TransactionalFileManager pipeline
10. **Undo System**: Leverage existing operation journaling and reverse transaction capabilities

### Batch Operation System Integration

- **FileOperationPreview**: Impact analysis, before/after states, directory visualization (400+ lines)

### IPC API Integration
[Source: architecture/ipc-apis-contracts.md]
**Existing Batch Operation Endpoints:**
- `batch:validate` - Pre-execution validation with safety checks

- `batch:failed` - Batch failure handling with error details and recovery options

### Suggestion to Operation Conversion
[Source: docs/stories/2.2.confidence-based-operation-filtering.md]
**Existing Suggestion Format:**
```typescript
interface Suggestion {
  id: string;
  fileId: string;
  type: 'rename' | 'move';
  originalPath: string;
  suggestedPath: string;
  confidence: number;
  reasoning: string;
  status: 'approved' | 'manual-review' | 'rejected';
}
```

**BatchOperation Format Required:**
```typescript
interface BatchOperation {
  id: string;
  fileId: string;
  type: 'rename' | 'move';
  originalPath: string;
  targetPath: string;
