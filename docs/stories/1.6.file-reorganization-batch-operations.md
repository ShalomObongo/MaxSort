## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context
Story 1.5 established the file analysis pipeline with AI-powered rename suggestions, confidence scoring, and database storage. The analysis system provides the foundation data (suggestions table with file_id, suggested_name, confidence, reasoning) that this story will consume for batch operations. The Agent Manager provides resource-aware task execution, and IPC endpoints exist for real-time communication. This story builds the execution layer that applies the analysis results to actual file operations.

### System Architecture Integration
[Source: architecture/system-components-logical.md]
- **Main Process**: Hosts batch operation orchestration and transactional file management
- **Worker Processes**: Handle compute-heavy batch operations with progress reporting  
- **Local Persistence**: SQLite operations table for transaction journaling and undo support
- **System Monitor**: Resource monitoring during intensive batch file operations

### Data Flow Integration
[Source: architecture/data-flow-sequence-typical-job.md]
- **Step 8**: User approves/edits suggestions; main enqueues apply-rename job (this story implements)
- **Step 9**: Transactional rename writes operations entry, performs filesystem rename, updates DB (core functionality)
- **Step 10**: Undo system replays reverse transaction from operations log (undo/redo implementation)

### Database Schema Requirements  
[Source: architecture/storage-schema-suggested-sqlite-tables.md]
**Operations table enhancements needed:**
- `operations` table: add `batch_id`, `parent_operation_id`, `undo_data` fields for batch tracking and undo support
- Add indexes on batch_id, job_id, timestamp for efficient batch operation queries
- Store undo_data as JSON with original file paths and metadata for complete reverse operations
- Track operation dependencies to prevent conflicts during batch execution

### Batch Operation Management
[Source: architecture/data-flow-sequence-typical-job.md]
- Group multiple rename suggestions into batches based on directory, file type, or user selection
- Implement size-based batching (max 100 operations per batch) and time-based grouping (collect for 2-5 seconds)
- Priority handling: user-triggered operations prioritized over background batch processing
- Integration with existing PriorityQueue system from Agent Manager for consistent task management

### File Operation Preview System  
[Source: architecture/ipc-apis-contracts.md]
- Generate before/after preview showing original filename → suggested filename transformation
- Include impact analysis: directory structure changes, potential naming conflicts, file extension changes
- Preview validation: check for filesystem constraints, permission issues, reserved names
- Real-time preview updates via IPC as user modifies selections or batch parameters

### Transactional File Operations
[Source: architecture/storage-schema-suggested-sqlite-tables.md]  
- Atomic operation execution: database transaction committed only after successful filesystem operation
- Operation validation: check file existence, permissions, destination conflicts before execution
- Partial failure recovery: handle scenarios where some files in batch succeed while others fail
- Filesystem safety: validate against system files, hidden files, and permission restrictions

### Undo/Redo System Architecture
[Source: architecture/data-flow-sequence-typical-job.md]
- Operation journaling: store complete operation metadata in operations table before execution
- Reverse operation generation: create undo commands for each operation type (rename → reverse rename)
- Transaction replay: implement reverse operation execution with same validation and safety checks
- Operation history: maintain chronological log of all operations with user identification and timestamps

### IPC API Extensions for Batch Operations
[Source: architecture/ipc-apis-contracts.md]  
**New batch operation endpoints:**
- `batch-preview`: Generate preview for selected suggestions with impact analysis
- `batch-execute`: Execute batch operation with real-time progress updates  
- `batch-progress`: Stream operation progress with completed/total counts and success rates
- `batch-cancel`: Cancel ongoing batch operation with partial rollback capability
- `operation-undo`: Undo specific operation or entire batch with reverse transaction execution
- `operation-history`: Retrieve operation history with filtering and pagination support

### Error Handling and Recovery Strategies
[Source: architecture/observability-error-handling.md]
- **Filesystem Errors**: Handle permission denied, disk full, file in use scenarios with user guidance
- **Partial Batch Failures**: Continue processing remaining operations while logging failures for retry
- **Conflicting Operations**: Detect filename conflicts and provide resolution options (skip, rename with suffix, user choice)
- **Undo Failures**: Handle cases where undo operations fail due to filesystem changes or permissions
- **Database Consistency**: Ensure operations table remains consistent with filesystem state through validation

### Performance and Resource Management
[Source: architecture/data-flow-sequence-typical-job.md]
- Target: Process 1000 file operations in <2 minutes with progress feedback
- Memory efficiency: Stream batch processing to avoid loading all operations in memory simultaneously  
- Concurrent operations: Limit concurrent filesystem operations to prevent system overload (max 10-20 concurrent)
- Progress tracking: Provide granular progress updates every 10-50 operations to maintain UI responsiveness

### Security and Safety Constraints
[Source: architecture/security-permissions-privacy.md]
- **Filesystem Safety**: Validate against system directories, hidden files, and critical application files
- **Permission Validation**: Check read/write permissions before operation execution
- **Operation Bounds**: Restrict operations to user-selected directories with explicit consent verification
- **Audit Logging**: Log all operations with user identification for security auditing and compliance

### File Structure and Implementation Locations
[Source: architecture/dev-repo-layout-recommended.md]
- **Batch Operation Manager**: `/app/src/lib/batch-operation-manager.ts`
- **File Operation Preview**: `/app/src/lib/file-operation-preview.ts`  
- **Transactional File Manager**: `/app/src/lib/transactional-file-manager.ts`
- **Operation Journal**: `/app/src/lib/operation-journal.ts`
- **IPC Extensions**: Extend `/app/src/main/main.ts` with batch operation endpoints
- **Database Extensions**: Extend `/app/src/lib/database.ts` with operations table enhancements

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- **Unit Tests**: Mock filesystem operations, test batch logic and undo generation
- **Integration Tests**: Complete pipeline from suggestion selection → batch execution → undo capability
- **Stress Tests**: Large batch operations (500+ files) with filesystem monitoring and resource tracking
- **Error Scenario Tests**: Filesystem failures, permission issues, partial batch failures with recovery validation
- **Manual UAT**: Test with real user directories containing mixed file types and complex structures

### Technical Constraints and Dependencies
- **Filesystem Operations**: Use Node.js fs/promises with proper async/await patterns for performance
- **Database Transactions**: SQLite WAL mode with proper transaction isolation for operation consistency
- **Operation Atomicity**: Each file operation must be atomic with proper rollback on failure
- **Progress Reporting**: Real-time progress updates via IPC without blocking main thread execution
- **Resource Limits**: Respect system memory and disk space constraints during large batch operations

## Testing

### Testing Standards  
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- **Test Location**: Tests in `/app/tests/` directory following existing patterns
- **Frameworks**: Jest for unit tests, integration test framework for pipeline testing  
- **Mock Strategy**: Mock filesystem operations for predictable testing, use temporary directories for integration
- **Coverage Requirements**: Minimum 80% test coverage for batch operation logic and error handling paths

### Specific Testing Requirements
- **Batch Operation Testing**: Test various batch sizes, priority handling, and resource management
- **Filesystem Simulation**: Create mock filesystem scenarios for comprehensive error testing  
- **Undo/Redo Validation**: Verify complete operation reversibility and state consistency
- **Performance Testing**: Validate batch processing performance targets and resource usage
- **Integration Testing**: Test complete workflow from analysis results to executed file operations
