# Story 2.2: Confidence-Based Operation Filtering

## Status
Complete

## Story
**As a** user (organized student),
**I want** to set confidence thresholds and auto-approve preferences for AI suggestions so that high-confidence operations execute automatically while low-confidence ones require manual review,
**so that** I can efficiently process file organization with appropriate levels of control based on my trust in AI suggestions.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Implement confidence threshold settings with predefined profiles (Conservative 90%+, Balanced 80%+, Aggressive 70%+) and custom threshold input
2. Add auto-approve functionality that automatically queues high-confidence suggestions for batch execution without manual review
3. Create filtering system that categorizes suggestions into auto-approve, manual review, and reject categories based on confidence scores
4. Implement user preference storage and persistence for threshold settings across application sessions
5. Add UI controls in settings for confidence threshold configuration with real-time preview of filtering effects
6. Integrate filtering logic with existing ConfidenceScorer to apply thresholds during suggestion processing
7. Create batch operation preparation that groups auto-approved suggestions for efficient execution
8. Add manual review queue for suggestions below auto-approve threshold but above rejection threshold
9. Implement override capabilities allowing users to manually promote or demote suggestions regardless of confidence scores
10. Add confidence-based statistics and reporting to show filtering effectiveness and suggestion quality distribution
