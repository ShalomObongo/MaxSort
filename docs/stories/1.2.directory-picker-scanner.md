# Story 1.2: Directory Picker and File Scanner

## Status
Complete

## Story
**As a** user (organized student),  
**I want** to select a directory and have the app scan and identify all files within it,  
**so that** I can begin the process of organizing and renaming my files with the AI agents.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Implement directory picker UI component in the renderer that allows users to select a target directory
2. Create secure IPC communication between renderer and main process for directory selection
3. Implement file scanner worker that recursively walks the selected directory and extracts basic metadata
4. Store scanned file metadata in SQLite database following the defined schema
5. Display scan progress to user with file count and current file being processed
6. Handle scanner errors gracefully (permission issues, invalid paths, etc.)
7. Implement basic include/exclude file pattern filtering during scan
8. Verify scan results are persisted and can be retrieved for the next stage of processing

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 1.1 established the foundational Electron project structure with React + TypeScript renderer, Node.js main process, and proper IPC channel setup. The SQLite and testing frameworks are already configured and ready for use.

### Project Structure
[Source: architecture/dev-repo-layout-recommended.md]
- Scanner worker should be created in `/app/src/workers/file-scanner.ts`
- Database utilities should be placed in `/app/src/lib/` directory
- UI components should be organized in `/app/src/renderer/components/`

### Data Models
[Source: architecture/storage-schema-suggested-sqlite-tables.md]
Required database schema:
- `files` table: `id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, path TEXT UNIQUE, sha256 TEXT, size INTEGER, mtime INTEGER, last_scanned_at INTEGER`
- `settings` table: `key TEXT PRIMARY KEY, value TEXT` for storing user preferences
- Use WAL journaling mode for concurrent access
- Consider external file cache for very long content to avoid DB bloat

### IPC Specifications
[Source: architecture/ipc-apis-contracts.md]
Required IPC channels:
- `scan-request` `{ rootPath, include, exclude, options }` ‚Üí main starts scanning
- `scan-progress` `{ fileCount, currentFile, percent }` ‚Üê main to renderer
- Security: Validate and sanitize all IPC payloads, do not allow renderer to request arbitrary FS paths without user consent

### System Components Integration
[Source: architecture/system-components-logical.md]
- **Renderer**: Lightweight React UI for directory picker and progress display
- **Main process**: Task orchestration and file system operations
- **Worker processes**: File scanning and metadata extraction in separate thread
- **Local persistence**: SQLite for file metadata storage

### Data Flow Integration
[Source: architecture/data-flow-sequence-typical-job.md]
This story implements steps 1-3 of the typical job flow:
1. User selects directory in UI ‚Üí `scan-request` IPC sent to Main
2. Main spawns worker to walk directory and extract metadata
3. Worker streams metadata; Main writes records to SQLite

### File System Operations
[Source: architecture/appendix-implementation-hints-references.md]
- Use Node.js `fs.promises` for async file operations
- Implement proper error handling for EACCES (permission denied) errors
- Consider using `fs.stat()` for metadata extraction
- Handle symbolic links appropriately during directory traversal

### Security Considerations
[Source: architecture/security-permissions-privacy.md]
- Validate all directory paths before scanning
- Implement proper sandboxing for file system access
- Log file access operations for debugging but respect user privacy
- Handle sensitive file types appropriately

### Testing
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- Unit tests should be placed in `/tests/unit` directory
- Focus on testing scanner worker logic and database operations
- Create integration tests for IPC communication flow
- Test error handling scenarios with mock file system operations
- Use the configured vitest framework for all testing

### Technical Constraints
- Scanner must operate in Node worker thread to avoid blocking main process
- Database operations must use WAL mode for concurrent access
- All file paths must be absolute and properly validated
- Progress reporting should not overwhelm the UI with too frequent updates
- Memory usage should be monitored during large directory scans
