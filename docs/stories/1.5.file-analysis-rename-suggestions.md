## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 1.4 established the Agent Manager with slot-based concurrency control, system memory monitoring, and priority task queue system. The Agent Manager provides the foundation for intelligent resource management during AI operations. The database schema includes agent task tracking, and IPC endpoints are available for real-time monitoring. This story will build on the Agent Manager to implement the core AI analysis pipeline.

### System Architecture Integration
[Source: architecture/system-components-logical.md]
- **Main Process**: Hosts file analysis orchestration and Agent Manager coordination
- **Agent Manager**: Controls AI model invocations with resource-aware slot management
- **Task Queue**: Priority-based system already implemented for agent task dispatch
- **Ollama Integration**: HTTP API calls for AI inference through existing OllamaClient
- **Worker Processes**: File scanning results feed into analysis task generation

### Data Flow Integration  
[Source: architecture/data-flow-sequence-typical-job.md]
- **Step 4**: Main enqueues per-file analyze tasks into Task Queue (implemented in this story)
- **Step 5**: Agent Manager dispatches tasks to sub-agents via Ollama (leverage existing implementation)
- **Step 6**: Ollama inference returns summaries/classifications (new prompt engineering)
- **Step 7**: Main computes confidence scores and emits preview-update IPC (new functionality)

### File Analysis Task Generation
[Source: architecture/data-flow-sequence-typical-job.md]
- Generate analysis tasks from file metadata stored in database after scanning
- Task payload includes: file_id, path, metadata, content_preview, priority
- Interactive tasks (user-triggered) prioritized over batch background analysis
- Tasks queued through existing PriorityQueue system in Agent Manager

### AI Prompt Engineering Requirements
[Source: architecture/system-components-logical.md]
- Design specialized prompts for different file types (PDF, images, documents, code)
- Include file metadata context: original filename, path structure, file size, content preview
- Request structured response format: suggested_name, confidence_score, reasoning
- Implement safety checks to prevent prompt injection or invalid responses
- Consider file privacy - only use metadata and content previews, not full content

### Confidence Scoring Algorithm
[Source: architecture/data-flow-sequence-typical-job.md]
- Calculate confidence based on AI response consistency and metadata alignment
- Factors: filename relevance, content match, structural patterns, existing conventions
- Scale: 0-100% with thresholds for auto-accept (>90%), review (50-90%), reject (<50%)
- Store confidence rationale for user transparency and system debugging

### Database Schema Extensions
[Source: architecture/storage-schema-suggested-sqlite-tables.md]
**Existing suggestions table to be enhanced:**
- `suggestions` table: add analysis_duration, model_version, content_hash fields
- Add indexes on file_id, confidence, timestamp for efficient querying
- Store reasoning text with size limits to prevent database bloat
- Track agent model performance metrics for optimization

### IPC API Extensions
[Source: architecture/ipc-apis-contracts.md]
**New analysis endpoints:**
- `analysis-start`: Begin analysis for specific files or entire scan
- `preview-update`: Stream suggestion updates with file_id, suggested_name, confidence, reasoning
- `analysis-progress`: Report analysis progress with completed/total counts
- `analysis-cancel`: Cancel ongoing analysis operations

### Error Handling Strategy
[Source: architecture/observability-error-handling.md]
- **AI Failures**: Retry with exponential backoff, fall back to simpler prompts
- **Timeout Handling**: Configurable per-task timeouts with graceful cancellation
- **Invalid Responses**: Response validation with sanitization and fallback suggestions
- **Resource Exhaustion**: Integrate with Agent Manager emergency eviction system
- **Network Issues**: Handle Ollama connectivity problems with offline degradation

### Security and Privacy
[Source: architecture/security-permissions-privacy.md]
- **Content Privacy**: Never log file contents, only metadata and analysis results
- **Prompt Sanitization**: Validate all prompts to prevent injection attacks
- **Response Validation**: Sanitize AI responses before database storage
- **Safe Filename Generation**: Ensure suggested names are filesystem-safe

### Performance Requirements
[Source: architecture/data-flow-sequence-typical-job.md]
- Target: 1000 files analyzed in <5 minutes on baseline hardware
- Memory efficiency: Leverage Agent Manager slot calculation for resource limits
- Concurrent analysis: Multiple files processed simultaneously within memory constraints
- Progressive preview: Stream results to UI as analysis completes per file

### File Structure and Locations
[Source: architecture/dev-repo-layout-recommended.md]
- **Analysis Task Generator**: `/app/src/lib/analysis-task-generator.ts`
- **File Analysis Service**: `/app/src/lib/file-analysis-service.ts`
- **Prompt Templates**: `/app/src/agents/prompt-templates.ts`
- **Confidence Scoring**: `/app/src/lib/confidence-scorer.ts`
- **IPC Extensions**: Extend `/app/src/main/main.ts` with analysis endpoints
- **Database Extensions**: Extend `/app/src/lib/database.ts` with suggestion enhancements

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- **Unit Tests**: Mock Ollama responses, test confidence scoring algorithms
- **Integration Tests**: Complete file → analysis → suggestion → preview pipeline
- **Stress Tests**: Concurrent analysis under memory pressure with Agent Manager
- **Manual UAT**: Test with real user files (PDFs, images, documents) for quality validation

### Technical Constraints
- **AI Response Format**: Structured JSON responses with validation and fallback parsing
- **Content Limits**: Limit file content preview size to prevent prompt bloat
- **Response Timeouts**: Configurable per-task timeouts (30-120 seconds based on model)
- **Memory Safety**: All analysis operations must respect Agent Manager resource limits
- **Filename Safety**: Generated names must be valid across macOS filesystem constraints
