## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 1.3 established the Ollama client with health monitoring, model discovery, and preference storage. The OllamaClient provides the foundation for model invocation, and the database schema includes model preference storage. The Agent Manager will build on this infrastructure to provide intelligent resource management.

### System Architecture Integration
[Source: architecture/system-components-logical.md]
- **Agent Manager**: Core component controlling model invocations and resource management
- **Main Process**: Hosts Agent Manager and coordinates with system monitoring
- **SystemMonitor**: Accurate macOS metrics using `vm_stat`/`sysctl` or native addon
- **Task Queue**: Priority-based queue system (interactive > batch > background)
- **Ollama Integration**: HTTP API calls through existing OllamaClient infrastructure

### Agent Manager Design Specifications
[Source: architecture/agent-manager-design-and-pseudocode.md]
- **Slot-based concurrency**: `available_for_agents = max(0, free_memory - reserved_for_os)`
- **Slot calculation**: `max_slots = floor(available_for_agents / (model_memory * safety_factor))`
- **Safety mechanisms**: Soft/hard/critical thresholds with progressive degradation
- **Priority queues**: Interactive tasks prioritized over scheduled batch tasks
- **Implementation**: Node.js class with 1000ms polling interval, adaptive to 500ms under stress

### Memory Monitoring Requirements  
[Source: architecture/memory-system-monitoring-details.md]
- **Polling intervals**: 1000ms default, 500ms when free memory < 20% or high agent activity
- **Metrics collection**: Free memory via `vm_stat`, per-PID RSS, CPU load averages
- **Threshold actions**: 
  - Soft: Stop new dispatches when free < safety_floor + 1GB
  - Hard: Abort lowest-priority tasks when free < safety_floor  
  - Critical: Stop all agents, flush queue, show alert
- **Implementation**: Use `spawn('vm_stat')` or native addon for precise macOS memory stats

### Data Flow Integration
[Source: architecture/data-flow-sequence-typical-job.md]
- **Task Generation**: Main process enqueues per-file analyze tasks into Agent Manager queue
- **Agent Assignment**: Agent Manager checks slots and dispatches to sub-agents via Ollama
- **Inference Execution**: Ollama runs models, returns summaries/classifications  
- **Result Processing**: Main computes confidence scores, stores suggestions, emits IPC updates

### File Structure and Locations
[Source: architecture/dev-repo-layout-recommended.md]
- **Agent Manager**: `/app/src/agents/agent-manager.ts`
- **System Monitor**: `/app/src/lib/system-monitor.ts` 
- **Priority Queue**: `/app/src/agents/priority-queue.ts`
- **Task Types**: `/app/src/agents/task-types.ts`
- **IPC Handlers**: Extend `/app/src/main/main.ts` with agent management endpoints
- **Database Extensions**: Extend `/app/src/lib/database.ts` with agent task tables

### Database Schema Extensions
[Source: architecture/storage-schema-suggested-sqlite-tables.md]
**New Tables Required:**
- `agent_tasks`: Task lifecycle tracking (id, type, status, priority, created_at, completed_at)
- `system_metrics`: Performance monitoring data (timestamp, free_memory, cpu_load, active_slots)
- `agent_performance`: Model execution statistics (model_name, avg_duration, success_rate)

### IPC API Contracts
[Source: architecture/ipc-apis-contracts.md]
**New Agent Management Endpoints:**
- `agent-status`: Get current agent status, queue depth, system health
- `agent-pause`: Pause new task dispatching  
- `agent-resume`: Resume normal operations
- `agent-emergency-stop`: Stop all running agents immediately
- `system-health`: Stream real-time memory and performance metrics

### Security and Error Handling
[Source: architecture/security-permissions-privacy.md, observability-error-handling.md]
- **Task Validation**: Sanitize all task parameters before execution
- **Resource Limits**: Enforce memory and timeout limits per task
- **Error Recovery**: Handle agent failures gracefully with task retry logic
- **Monitoring**: Log all agent operations for debugging and performance analysis
- **Privacy**: No task content logged, only metadata and performance metrics

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- **Unit Tests**: Mock SystemMonitor and Ollama for AgentManager logic testing
- **Integration Tests**: Complete scanning → agent execution → result pipeline
- **Stress Tests**: Low-memory conditions, high concurrency scenarios
- **Performance Tests**: Validate emergency eviction and threshold behaviors
- **Multi-arch Testing**: Intel x64 and Apple Silicon ARM64 compatibility

### Technical Constraints
- **Memory Safety**: Must respect safety floor (2GB) and safety factor (1.5x) at all times
- **Polling Efficiency**: Balance monitoring accuracy with CPU overhead
- **Task Timeouts**: All agent invocations must have configurable timeouts
- **Graceful Degradation**: System must remain functional under resource pressure
- **Error Recovery**: Handle Ollama unavailability and model loading failures
- **Platform Specific**: macOS-optimized memory monitoring using system-specific APIs
