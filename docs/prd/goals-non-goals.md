# Goals & Non-Goals

**Goals**
1. Enable users to **analyze, rename, and reorganize directories** using Ollama local models.  
2. Provide an **agentic system** with a configurable main agent + lightweight sub-agents.  
3. Implement **real-time memory monitoring** to prevent overload, with dynamic throttling of sub-agents.  
4. Deliver a **user-friendly macOS app** (Electron-based) with previews, undo, and confidence scores for renames.  
5. Ensure **privacy-first operation** (no data leaves local machine).  

**Non-Goals**
1. Not aiming for **cloud-based file management** (local-only in v1).  
2. Not a full **file backup/sync solution** (focus is organization, not redundancy).  
3. Not initially targeting **cross-platform builds** (Windows/Linux may come later).  
4. No advanced **semantic search across files** in MVP (could be a v2+ feature).
