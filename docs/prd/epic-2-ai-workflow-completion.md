# Epic 2: AI Analysis to File Operations Workflow - Brownfield Enhancement

## Epic Goal

Connect the existing AI analysis pipeline to the batch operation system, enabling users to execute AI-recommended file operations through the existing dashboard workflow.

## Epic Description

**Existing System Context:**

- Current relevant functionality: Complete MVP infrastructure with file scanning, AI analysis pipeline, batch operation management, and comprehensive UI
- Technology stack: Electron + React + TypeScript + SQLite + Ollama + Agent Manager + Worker Threads
- Integration points: Dashboard workflow connects DirectoryPicker → ModelSelector → Analysis → Operations → History

**Enhancement Details:**

- What's being added/changed: Three focused workflow connections to complete the user experience
- How it integrates: Leverages existing ConfidenceScorer, BatchOperationManager, FileAnalysisService, and TransactionalFileManager
- Success criteria: Users can complete end-to-end file organization through the guided dashboard workflow

## Stories

### Story 2.1: Analysis Workflow Integration
Connect the dashboard's "Start Scan" step to the existing FileAnalysisService, displaying real-time AI analysis results with confidence scores and suggested operations in the UI.

### Story 2.2: Confidence-Based Operation Filtering  
Implement confidence thresholds and auto-approve functionality, allowing users to set preferences for automatic operation approval based on AI confidence scores (Conservative/Balanced/Aggressive profiles).

### Story 2.3: Execute AI-Recommended Operations
Connect approved suggestions to the existing BatchOperationManager, enabling users to execute file operations through the transactional system with full undo capabilities.

## Compatibility Requirements

- [x] Existing APIs remain unchanged - leveraging FileAnalysisService, ConfidenceScorer, BatchOperationManager
- [x] Database schema changes are backward compatible - using existing suggestions and operations tables  
- [x] UI changes follow existing patterns - extending Dashboard workflow component
- [x] Performance impact is minimal - building on existing Agent Manager resource controls

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk:** User workflow integration complexity between existing systems
- **Mitigation:** Leverage existing IPC channels and component patterns, incremental integration testing
- **Rollback Plan:** Dashboard can revert to current placeholder components, existing systems remain functional

## Definition of Done

- [x] All stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- [x] Existing functionality verified through testing  
- [x] Integration points working correctly
- [x] Documentation updated appropriately
- [x] No regression in existing features
- [x] Complete end-to-end user workflow functional from directory selection to operation execution

## Story Manager Handoff

**Story Manager Handoff:**

"Please develop detailed user stories for this brownfield epic. Key considerations:

- This is an enhancement to an existing system running Electron + React + TypeScript + SQLite + Ollama
- Integration points: Dashboard.tsx workflow, FileAnalysisService, ConfidenceScorer, BatchOperationManager, TransactionalFileManager
- Existing patterns to follow: IPC communication patterns, React component architecture, Agent Manager task dispatch
- Critical compatibility requirements: All existing MVP systems must remain functional and performant
- Each story must include verification that existing functionality remains intact

The epic should maintain system integrity while delivering complete user workflow from directory scan to operation execution."
